# Hello-World
First time finally learning github during these crazy times of being locked in at home.  I am actually feeling safe now that I dont go outside much at all anymore now.  I grew up in the 90's and late 80's.  Im one of those kids that wanted a computer when I was a kid and got my first Commodore 64 with a 1541 Floppy disk drive, Data casette, Okidata Microline printer, and a 2400 baud modem.  I learned so much in my younger days that by the time I went to college and majored in computer science the classes were no challenge for me at all.  So the Electrical engineering tech Professor talked me into switching majorsw to electronics which I had very very little practical knoledge at all.  I learned so much more that I ever thought I would.  I minored in industrial automation which right now with the IOT boom I feel right at home.  Eager to relearn and try all kinds of cool new projects.
